## Research Questions

The following are the research questions we want to answer through this master thesis:

1. Is it possible to predict the future states of the other objects in the autonomous driving environment and plan the path of the self-driving vehicle using Active Inference approach?
2. What is the possibility to derive uncertainty-based estimators for prediction and planning in autonomous driving?
3. Is it possible to increase the performance of a Deep Active Inference Model using temporal ensemble?
